Among the editors and IDEs that I use the old stand by vim is always
there. It's literally the first thing I install on a server. One of the
great features of vim is the vast plugin library. This becomes even
better when someone wraps a lot of the extremely useful ones in to an
installable package.

**Enter [SPF13 vim by Steve
Francia](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim).**

It has my favorite plugin NERDTree plus a ton of others that I didn't
know I loved until I installed this package.

This is an awesome vim setup!

One word of warning vim needs to be 7.4+ for the plugins installed with
the installer to work.
