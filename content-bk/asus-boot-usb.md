I needed to reinstall Lint Mint on my Asus Laptop. I couldn't figure out
how to boot to usb. Turns out it's a tricky procedure.

-   Have your USB drive plugged in
-   Turn the Zenbook on
-   Enter UEFI by pounding on the esc key
-   Arrow to the right to the "Boot" tab
-   Press F10, choose "save & exit"
-   I'll reboot. Once it begins, immediately pound on esc again
-   Arrow over to the "Boot" tab. USB drive should be listed. Switch
    order if needed.
-   Press F10, choose "save & exit"
