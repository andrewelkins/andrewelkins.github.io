First, the easier way to do this is to use rsync in the first place.

> rsync -avh --progress sourceDirectory destinationDirectory

However, sometime you think cp will be quick and you already kicked it
off. Here is a quick way to check the progress of a copy command after
you've already started.

> watch lsof -p\`pgrep -x cp\`

This will let you know what it is transferring and how much it has left
to do. In a way it provides a way to check the progress of the cp,
copyÂ comand.
