After working within a screen session on a CentOS server I had forgotten
how to close the screen session that I was done with. It's a rather
simple command.

> exit

Perfect, exit means exit.

Of note if you just want to disconnect use.

> ctrl+a
>
> (press) d

That'll disconnect you from the screen session.
