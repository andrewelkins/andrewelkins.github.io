The second talk that I attended of the conference was on an overview of
Zend Framework 2 (ZF2). Although I thought it was going to go over the
Event Driven Actions in ZF2, they changed it due to popular demand.

The ZendCon website gave this description:

> One of the most anticipated topics of this year's ZendCon is what is
> new in ZF2. Learn about the core features now available, the
> development approaches they enable, and get a preview of the new MVC
> layer of Zend Framework 2 in action

###### Since it was an overview there wasn't a ton of information presented that I hadn't read already. What was reinforced for me was the use of namespaces. ZF2 relies heavily on namespaces which is a good thing.

Another key item that was brought up was dependency injection which is a
key addition to ZF2. It allows the OO code to reduce the amount of
coupling and reliance on other code to function. See this very
goodÂ [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/fabpot/dependency-injection-with-php-and-php-53)
on the advantages on dependency injection if you're not quite sure what
it is.

In general, this was an overview of the ZF2 functionality. It was really
nothing more than a brief summary of the topics on the ["How to
start"](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=42303506)
page.

Overall it was a good overall presentation if you wanted an overview. If
you were looking for a more in depth presentation, like I was, it
wouldn't fit your needs.
