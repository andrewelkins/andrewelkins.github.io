container the volume that was previously attached fails to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case it was a dev image and the quickest, and dirtiest, option
was to clear out and rebuild. I could go one by one to delete the
specific volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker volume ls  
docker volume rm {specific\_docker\_container}  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead I chose to delete all volumes not currently in use. This worked
for my use case as I only have two dockers setups, left the one I wanted
to keep running while executing the following commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker volume rm \`docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true\`  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content></entry></feed>
