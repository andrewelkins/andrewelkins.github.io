### When will Laravel 4 be released?

Per Taylor's announcement at Laracon it will be released in May of 2013.
Further on the [wiki](http://wiki.laravel.io/Laravel_4)Â there is a time
table for the next 4 releases.

### Is Laravel 4 stable enough to use in production?

I would say yes. At this point in development there are a lot less items
up for change. In the previous months I have seen major things change
and break existing sites that I have running Laravel 4. These types of
events have calmed down lately. I feel comfortable launching a site in
Laravel 4 today. In fact, if you need a start in Laravel 4, check out
the[starter site on
github](https://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site).

**\*Update\***

Release date is May 27th 2013!
