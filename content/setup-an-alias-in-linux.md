Setting up an alias in linux is very easy and very helpful. It allows
you to determine a short phrase for running a longer command. Or change
a common typo to the command you meant.

Here's an example alias:

> \$ alias lsl="ls -la"

This maps lsl to the command ls -la which is half the length and since
that's a common command that'll help out.

Another example

> \$ aliasÂ h='history'

This shows the history of the terminal session.
